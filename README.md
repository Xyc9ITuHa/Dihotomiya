## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Beef:

1. Season beef tenderloin with salt and pepper.
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over high heat.
3. Sear the beef on all sides (1–2 minutes per side) until browned.
4. Remove from heat, let it rest for a few minutes, then brush with mustard.
5. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 15–20 minutes.

### 2. Make the Duxelles:

1. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter.
2. Add mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and thyme.
3. Cook until mixture is dry and all moisture has evaporated, about 10–15 minutes.
4. Season with salt and pepper, then let cool completely.

### 3. Assemble the Wellington:

1. Lay out a layer of plastic wrap.
2. Arrange prosciutto in a slightly overlapping layer on the wrap.
3. Spread cooled duxelles over the prosciutto.
4. Place the beef on top.
5. Using the plastic wrap, roll the ham and mushroom layer around the beef tightly.
6. Twist ends of the plastic wrap to secure and refrigerate for 15 minutes.

### 4. Wrap in Puff Pastry:

1. Roll out puff pastry on a floured surface.
2. Unwrap the beef from plastic and place on the pastry.
3. Fold and seal the pastry around the beef, trimming excess as needed.
4. Place seam-side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
5. Brush with egg wash.
6. (Optional) Decorate with pastry scraps and brush again.

### 5. Bake:

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Bake for 35–40 minutes, or until pastry is golden and internal temperature of beef is 125°F (52°C) for medium-rare.
3. Let rest 10–15 minutes before slicing.
